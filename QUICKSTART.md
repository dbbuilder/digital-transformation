3. Discuss client context and goals (45 min)
4. Schedule stakeholder interviews (20 min)
5. Next steps (10 min)
```

**Step 2: Stakeholder Interviews (Week 1)**

- Document evidence (current metrics, screenshots, diagrams)
```

**Step 3: Current State Documentation (End of Week 1)**
```
Document:
1. Technology inventory per tier (UI, API, Data, Cloud, AI)
2. Pain points and challenges
3. Current metrics (performance, cost, uptime)
4. Compliance requirements
5. Key risks

Use:

   - API: Microservices, API gateway, auth
   - Data: Cloud database, data platform
   - Cloud: Container orchestration, IaC
   - AI: (If AI path) ML platform, LLMs, RAG

Use: TECHNOLOGY_EVOLUTION.md for technology options

```

**Step 2: Roadmap Planning (4 hours)**
```
Use:
- TODO.md (adapt 12-phase plan to client context)
- Implementation_Roadmap.xlsx

Define:
1. Phases and timeline (adjust from 32-week baseline)
2. Wave-based migration (prioritize by business value)
3. Dependencies and sequencing
4. Resource requirements
5. Budget estimate

Output: Client-specific transformation roadmap
```

**Step 3: Compliance Review (2 hours)**
```
Use: COMPLIANCE_LEGAL.md

For client's industry and geography:
1. Identify applicable regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, etc.)
2. Map controls to transformation tiers
3. Identify gaps
4. Define compliance integration plan

### First Task: Build a Component (Example)

**Scenario**: Build accessible Button component

```markdown
# Task: Button Component

## Requirements (from REQUIREMENTS.md):
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Keyboard navigable
- Supports variants (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Storybook story

## Implementation Checklist:
[ ] Read CLAUDE.md Section on Component patterns
[ ] Create Button.tsx in src/components/
[ ] Implement with proper TypeScript types
[ ] Add ARIA attributes
[ ] Write unit tests (Vitest)
[ ] Create Storybook story
[ ] Test with keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space)
[ ] Test with screen reader
[ ] Code review with team
[ ] Deploy to Storybook
```

**Reference Code Pattern** (from CLAUDE.md):
```typescript
// src/components/Button/Button.tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary'
  disabled?: boolean
  onClick: () => void
  children: React.ReactNode
  ariaLabel?: string
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant,
  disabled,
  onClick,
  children,
  ariaLabel
}) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={`button button--${variant}`}
      disabled={disabled}
      onClick={onClick}
      aria-label={ariaLabel}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## For Architects: Technology Decisions

### Decision Framework (30 minutes per decision)

**Example: Choose Frontend Framework**

**Step 1**: List options (from TECHNOLOGY_EVOLUTION.md Section 2.1.3)
- React, Vue, Angular, Svelte

**Step 2**: Score against criteria (TECHNOLOGY_EVOLUTION.md Section 7)
```
Criteria:
- Maturity (20%)
- Ecosystem (20%)
- Team skills (25%)
- Performance (15%)
- TypeScript support (10%)
- Enterprise suitability (10%)

Scoring (1-5 scale):
React: 4.2 weighted average
Vue: 4.0 weighted average
Angular: 3.8 weighted average
Svelte: 3.5 weighted average
```

**Step 3**: Document decision
```markdown
# ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection

## Decision
Selected: React 18 with TypeScript

## Rationale
- Team has React experience (5/7 developers)
- Largest ecosystem for component libraries
- Strong TypeScript support
- Hiring market favorable

## Alternatives Considered
- Vue 3: Excellent but smaller ecosystem
- Angular: Too opinionated for our needs
- Svelte: Too new, hiring concerns

## Consequences
- Commit to React patterns and hooks
- Invest in React training for 2 developers
- Build on React ecosystem (Vite, Zustand, React Router)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Where do I start? Too much documentation!"
→ Go to INDEX.md, find your role, follow the recommended reading order (1-2 hours max)

### "What technology should we use for [X]?"
→ Go to TECHNOLOGY_EVOLUTION.md Section for your tier, use decision matrix in Section 7

### "How do I run a sprint?"
→ Use ITERATION_TEMPLATES.md Section 2 (Sprint planning through retrospective)

### "What about compliance for [regulation]?"
→ Go to COMPLIANCE_LEGAL.md, find your regulation, use checklist in Section 8

### "How do I govern AI models?"
→ Start with AI_GOVERNANCE.md Section 3 (Risk assessment), then Section 6 (Lifecycle)

### "I need to brief executives"
→ Use ITERATION_TEMPLATES.md Section 5.1 (Executive update template)
