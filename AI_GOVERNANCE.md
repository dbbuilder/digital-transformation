## 4. Responsible AI Practices

### 4.1 Fairness and Bias Mitigation

**Bias Types**
```
1. Data Bias
   ├── Historical Bias: Training data reflects past discrimination
   ├── Representation Bias: Underrepresentation of certain groups
   ├── Measurement Bias: Features measured differently across groups
   └── Label Bias: Labels themselves biased (e.g., biased human decisions)

2. Algorithmic Bias
   ├── Feature Importance: Model relies on proxy for protected attribute
   ├── Regularization Bias: Optimization favors majority class
   └── Aggregation Bias: One model for all doesn't fit subgroups well

3. Interaction Bias
   ├── Feedback Loop: Model decisions influence future data
   └── User Interaction Bias: Different user groups interact differently
```

**Fairness Metrics**
```
Choose metrics based on use case:

1. Demographic Parity (Statistical Parity)
   ├── Definition: Positive outcome rate same across groups
   ├── Formula: P(Ŷ=1|A=0) = P(Ŷ=1|A=1) where A is protected attribute
   ├── Use Case: Marketing, recommendations
   └── Trade-off: May sacrifice accuracy

2. Equal Opportunity
   ├── Definition: True positive rate same across groups
   ├── Formula: P(Ŷ=1|Y=1,A=0) = P(Ŷ=1|Y=1,A=1)
   ├── Use Case: Loan approvals, hiring (where false negatives costly)
   └── Focuses on qualified individuals

3. Equalized Odds
   ├── Definition: Both TPR and FPR same across groups
   ├── More stringent than Equal Opportunity
   └── Use Case: Criminal justice, medical diagnosis

4. Predictive Parity
   ├── Definition: Precision same across groups
   ├── Formula: P(Y=1|Ŷ=1,A=0) = P(Y=1|Ŷ=1,A=1)
   └── Use Case: When false positives have different costs across groups
```

**Fairness Testing Process**
```
1. Identify Protected Attributes
   ├── Legal protected classes: Race, gender, age, disability, religion, etc.
   ├── Context-specific: Geography, socioeconomic status, language
   └── Proxy detection: Features correlated with protected attributes

2. Stratified Evaluation
   ├── Split test set by protected groups
   ├── Measure metrics per group
   ├── Compare across groups
   └── Statistical significance testing

3. Mitigation Techniques

   Pre-Processing (Data):
   ├── Re-sampling (oversample minority, undersample majority)
   ├── Re-weighting (assign higher weights to underrepresented groups)
   └── Synthetic data generation (SMOTE, GANs)

   In-Processing (Model):
   ├── Fairness constraints during training (e.g., Fairlearn, AIF360)
   ├── Adversarial debiasing (train model to be fair even if attacked)
   └── Multi-task learning (predict outcome + fairness objectives)

   Post-Processing (Predictions):
   ├── Threshold optimization (different thresholds per group)
   ├── Reject option classification (defer uncertain cases to human)
   └── Calibration (ensure probabilities calibrated across groups)

4. Documentation
   ├── Fairness metrics in model card
   ├── Justification for chosen metric
   ├── Trade-offs (accuracy vs. fairness)
   └── Residual bias and ongoing monitoring plan
```

### 4.2 Explainability and Transparency

**Explainability Levels**
```
1. Global Explanations
   ├── Feature Importance: Which features matter most overall?
   ├── Partial Dependence Plots: How does each feature affect prediction?
   ├── Techniques: SHAP global, permutation importance, PDP
   └── Use Case: Understanding model behavior, debugging

2. Local Explanations
   ├── Individual Prediction: Why this specific prediction for this user?
   ├── Techniques: SHAP local, LIME, attention maps (for NLP/CV)
   └── Use Case: User transparency, contestability

3. Counterfactual Explanations
   ├── "What would need to change for different outcome?"
   ├── Actionable insights for users
   └── Techniques: DiCE, contrastive explanations
```

**Implementation**
```
Model Intrinsic Explainability:
├── Linear Models: Coefficients directly interpretable
├── Decision Trees / Random Forests: Feature splits, tree depth
├── Rule-Based Models: Explicit IF-THEN rules
└── Trade-off: Often lower accuracy than black-box models

Model-Agnostic Techniques:
├── SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
│   ├── Game theory-based
│   ├── Consistent and locally accurate
│   ├── Works for any model
│   └── Computationally expensive
├── LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
│   ├── Perturb input, train local surrogate model
│   ├── Faster than SHAP
│   └── Less stable
├── Integrated Gradients (for neural networks)
└── Attention Mechanisms (built into Transformers)

Deep Learning Specific:

├── Saliency Maps (which pixels matter for image classification)
├── Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
└── GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)
```

**User-Facing Transparency**
```
Disclose AI Usage:
├── UI indicators when AI is involved ("AI-generated", "AI-powered")
├── Explain role of AI (assist, recommend, automate)
├── Provide opt-out or human alternative (when feasible)
└── Link to AI transparency policy

For High-Stakes Decisions:
├── Provide explanation alongside decision
│   Example: "Loan denied due to: Debt-to-income ratio (60%), Credit history (30%), Employment status (10%)"
├── Allow users to contest decision
├── Human review process
└── Appeal mechanism

Model Cards:
├── Intended use and limitations

   └── Pseudonymization / tokenization

2. Differential Privacy
   ├── Add calibrated noise to data or model
   ├── Guarantees: Individual records not identifiable
   ├── Trade-off: Accuracy decreases with more privacy
   ├── Tools: Google DP library, IBM diffprivlib, Opacus (PyTorch)
   └── Use Case: Aggregate analytics, federated learning

3. Federated Learning
   ├── Train models on decentralized data (data stays on device/server)
   ├── Only model updates shared, not data
   ├── Use Case: Mobile keyboard predictions, healthcare (hospitals don't share data)
   ├── Frameworks: TensorFlow Federated, PySyft, NVIDIA FLARE
   └── Challenges: Communication overhead, heterogeneous data

4. Encrypted Machine Learning
   ├── Homomorphic Encryption: Compute on encrypted data
   ├── Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC): Multiple parties compute jointly without revealing data
   ├── Use Case: Highly sensitive data (financial, healthcare)
   └── Trade-off: Extremely slow (10-1000x slower)

5. Synthetic Data Generation
   ├── Generate realistic fake data that preserves statistical properties
   ├── Use synthetic data for training
   ├── Tools: Gretel, Mostly AI, SDV (Synthetic Data Vault)
   └── Risk: Still potential for membership inference, requires validation
```

**GDPR Compliance for AI**
```
Right to Explanation (Article 22):

├── Challenge: Unlearning from trained model
├── Approaches:
│   ├── Retrain model without user's data (expensive)
│   ├── Model unlearning techniques (research area)
│   └── Practical: Delete raw data, mark model as "trained on deleted data"
└── Document process in DPIAs
