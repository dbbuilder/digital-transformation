## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"DigiForm is a digital transformation planning toolkit for consultants. It provides a proven four-corner framework, structured interview templates, and auto-generates professional deliverables like PowerPoint decks and SOWs—cutting planning time from weeks to days. It works completely offline, so your client data stays private."

### Extended Pitch (2 minutes)

"Digital transformation is complex. Organizations need to modernize across five tiers—UI, API, Data, Cloud, and AI—while managing risk, compliance, and organizational change.

DigiForm gives consultants a **proven methodology** to plan transformations systematically:

1. **Discover**: 40+ interview questions across all 5 tiers, both business and technical tracks
2. **Visualize**: Four-corner framework diagrams showing current state, future state, and transformation paths
3. **Plan**: 32-week roadmaps with dependencies, milestones, and resource allocation
4. **Deliver**: Auto-generated PowerPoint executive decks, technical docs, and governance templates

What makes DigiForm unique is the **dual-path approach**: we support both AI-Included and AI-Free transformation paths, because not every organization is ready for AI—especially in healthcare, finance, and government.

It's **offline-first**, so you can work at secure client sites without internet, and **privacy-first**, so no client data ever leaves your browser. Consultants save 80% of their deliverable creation time, and clients get professional, consistent output every time."
