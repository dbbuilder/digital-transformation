# Digital Transformation Planning System - Implementation TODO

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Active Development

---

## Product Vision

### V1.0: Complete Consulting Interview Work Kit (Current Focus)
**Target Release**: Q2 2026

Version 1.0 is a **complete, offline-first consulting toolkit** for digital transformation planning. It enables consultants to:

1. **Conduct Discovery Interviews**: 100+ structured interview questions across 5 transformation tiers (UI, API, Data, Cloud, AI)
2. **Support Dual Transformation Paths**:
   - **AI-Included Path**: For organizations ready to leverage AI/ML with proper governance
   - **AI-Free Path**: For compliance-heavy or risk-averse organizations seeking deterministic modernization
3. **Create Transformation Plans**: Four-corner framework visualization, tier-by-tier roadmaps, and 32-week implementation timelines
4. **Generate Professional Deliverables**: Executive decks (PPTX), technical docs (PDF), roadmaps (Excel), diagrams (SVG/PNG), and governance templates
5. **Work Offline**: Complete functionality without internet connection, privacy-preserving, no external data transmission
6. **Manage Multiple Projects**: Track multiple client engagements with import/export capabilities

**Key Principle**: V1.0 is a fully functional product on its own‚Äînot a prototype. Consultants can use it end-to-end for real client engagements.

### V2.0+: Shared Online Service (Future Vision)
**Target Release**: 2026-2027 (See FUTURE.md)

Future versions will add:
- Real-time collaboration for consulting teams
- Cloud sync across devices
- Template marketplace and best practices sharing
- Advanced analytics and benchmarking
- Enterprise integrations (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- AI-powered recommendations and automation

**Migration Path**: V1.0 projects will seamlessly migrate to V2.0 cloud service when ready. Users can choose to remain offline-only indefinitely.
