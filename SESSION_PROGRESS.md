# Development Session Progress

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Interview System Implementation
**Status**: Core interview system complete, ready for testing

---

## 🎯 Session Accomplishments

### 1. Updated Project Vision and Planning ✅

**Updated Files**:
- `TODO.md` - Added comprehensive V1.0/V2.0 vision, marked Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 in progress
- `README.md` - Updated with clear product positioning as "consulting interview work kit"
- `PROJECT_VISION.md` - NEW - Complete strategic vision document with market analysis, roadmap, and success criteria

**Key Clarifications**:
- V1.0 is a **complete product**, not an MVP - consultants can use it for real client engagements
- V2.0+ is the evolution to a collaborative cloud platform
- Dual-path (AI-Included vs AI-Free) is core to the methodology, not an add-on
- Clear path from offline-first (V1.0) to shared online service (V2.0+)

### 2. Implemented CSV Interview Template Import System ✅

**New Files Created**:
- `app/src/lib/csvImporter.ts` - Complete CSV parsing and import service
  - `parseInterviewCSV()` - Parse CSV content to InterviewQuestion array
  - `importInterviewQuestions()` - Import questions to database
  - `seedInterviewQuestions()` - Load all templates on app initialization
  - Helper functions: `getQuestionsByPhaseTier()`, `getQuestionsByPhase()`, `getQuestionsByTier()`, `searchQuestions()`

**CSV Data Migration**:
- Copied 4 CSV interview templates to `app/public/data/`:
  - `Interview_Templates_Discovery_AI.csv`
  - `Interview_Templates_Foundation_AI.csv`
  - `Interview_Templates_Modernization_AI.csv`
  - `Interview_Templates_Intelligence_AI.csv`
- Templates will be fetched and imported on first app load

**Database Integration**:
- Updated `app/src/main.tsx` to call `seedInterviewQuestions()` on app startup
- Questions are stored in IndexedDB `interviewQuestions` table
- Sample data: ~40 questions across 4 phases, 5 tiers, 2 tracks (Business/Technical)

### 3. Built Interview Form UI Components ✅

**New Components Created**:

1. **`app/src/components/assessments/AssessmentList.tsx`**
   - Matrix view of all assessments (5 phases × 5 tiers)
   - Color-coded status indicators (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
   - Progress percentage display
   - One-click assessment creation
   - Summary cards showing total, completed, and in-progress counts

2. **`app/src/components/assessments/InterviewForm.tsx`**
   - Question-by-question interview interface
   - Progress tracking (answered X of Y questions)
   - Response capture with auto-save to IndexedDB
   - Notes/evidence field for each question
   - Navigation: Previous/Next buttons
   - Quick jump to any question (numbered buttons)
   - Visual indicators for answered vs unanswered questions
   - AI readiness considerations displayed for each question
   - Priority tags (High/Medium/Low)
   - Track tags (Business/Technical)

3. **`app/src/components/assessments/AssessmentsPage.tsx`**
   - Parent container that manages navigation between AssessmentList and InterviewForm
   - State management for selected assessment
   - Back navigation and completion handling

### 4. Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration ✅

**Issue**: Tailwind CSS v4 uses a different configuration system than v3
**Solution**: Updated `app/src/index.css` to use `@theme` directive with CSS custom properties
**Result**: Build now succeeds with all primary colors properly defined

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow
```
CSV Templates (public/data/)
   ↓
csvImporter.ts (parse & import)
   ↓
IndexedDB (interviewQuestions table)
   ↓
InterviewForm component (display & capture)
   ↓
IndexedDB (assessmentResponses table)
   ↓
Assessment completion tracking
```

### Component Hierarchy
```
AssessmentsPage
├── AssessmentList (5×5 matrix view)
│   └── Creates new Assessment records
└── InterviewForm (selected assessment)
    ├── Loads questions from interviewQuestions table
    ├── Displays one question at a time
    ├── Captures responses to assessmentResponses table
    └── Calculates completion percentage
```

### State Management
- **Zustand Store** (`useAppStore`): UI state, project context, filters
- **IndexedDB** (Dexie): All persistent data (projects, assessments, responses, questions)
- **Auto-save**: Responses saved immediately on input change
- **Persistence**: Zustand state persisted to localStorage for UI preferences

## 🧪 Testing Next Steps

### Manual Testing Needed
1. Run `npm run dev` in `app/` directory
2. Verify CSV templates are imported on first load (check browser console)
3. Create a sample project (if not already exists)
4. Navigate to assessments for that project
5. Click "Start Assessment" for Discovery - UI
6. Verify questions load from database
7. Answer a few questions and verify auto-save works
8. Navigate between questions using Previous/Next and Quick Jump
9. Go back to assessment list and verify progress is saved
10. Check that completion percentage updates correctly

### Potential Issues to Watch For
- [ ] CSV fetch might fail if dev server doesn't serve `/data/` correctly
- [ ] Auto-save debouncing might cause UX lag
- [ ] IndexedDB quota limits (unlikely in development)
- [ ] Large number of assessments might slow down matrix rendering

## 📋 Next Development Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Test the interview system end-to-end** - Verify CSV import, question display, response capture
2. **Create assessment dashboard** - Visual completion metrics, tier-by-tier progress charts
3. **Add response validation** - Ensure critical questions are answered before marking complete
4. **Implement evidence file attachment** - Allow users to upload supporting documents

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
5. **Educational content integration** - Convert Markdown playbooks to searchable, bookmarkable content
6. **Project management UI** - Create project list, project detail pages, project creation wizard
7. **Four-corner diagram builder** (Phase 3) - Core methodology visualization

### Medium-Term (Next Month)
8. **Decision framework tool** - AI-Included vs AI-Free path recommendation engine
9. **Roadmap builder** - 32-week timeline generation
10. **Start deliverable generation** - PowerPoint deck generator (CRITICAL for V1.0)

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **FIXED** - TypeScript import error for Dexie `Table` type (used `type Table` import)
2. **FIXED** - Rollup module not found (reinstalled node_modules)
3. **FIXED** - Tailwind CSS v4 custom colors not recognized (used `@theme` directive)

---

## 📦 Build Status

- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ Passing
- **Vite Build**: ✅ Passing (5.76s)
- **Bundle Size**: 307.65 KB (97.10 KB gzipped) - Well within target of <500KB
- **Linting**: Not yet run (ESLint configured but no lint script in package.json)

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Tailwind CSS v4** uses `@theme` directive and CSS custom properties, not JavaScript config
2. **Dexie.js** `Table` type must be imported as `type Table` when `verbatimModuleSyntax` is enabled
3. **CSV parsing** needs to handle quoted fields properly (commas inside quotes)
4. **Auto-save** in forms should debounce to avoid excessive database writes (not yet implemented)
5. **IndexedDB** queries are asynchronous - need to handle loading states properly
6. **Component organization** by feature (assessments/, projects/, four-corner/) is cleaner than by type

---

## 💡 Design Decisions

1. **One question at a time** interview interface (vs. scrolling list) - Better UX for focus, easier to track progress
2. **Quick jump buttons** numbered 1-N - Fast navigation for users who want to skip around
3. **Auto-save on input** - No explicit "Save" button needed, reduced cognitive load
4. **Visual indicators** for answered questions (green backgrounds) - Clear progress visualization
5. **Matrix view** for assessments - Quick overview of completion across all phases/tiers

## 📚 Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Add "Running the Application" section to README.md
- [ ] Document CSV template format in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md with interview system architecture
- [ ] Create user guide for assessment workflow
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues

## 🚀 Ready for Next Session

The interview system is now built and ready for testing. Once tested and any bugs are fixed, we can move on to:

1. **Assessment Dashboard** - Visual metrics and progress tracking
2. **Educational Content** - Integrate the 500+ pages of playbooks and methodology
3. **Project Management** - Create the project list and detail views
4. **Four-Corner Diagrams** - Start on the core visual planning tool

**Estimated Completion**: Phase 2 (Interview System) is ~70% complete after testing and dashboard implementation.
