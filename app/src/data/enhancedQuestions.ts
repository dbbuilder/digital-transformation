    detailedQuestion: 'User Journey Prioritization and Impact Assessment: We need to identify the three most critical user workflows that, if improved, would deliver the greatest business value. For each journey, we must understand the complete context: who the users are, what they\'re trying to accomplish, what\'s currently preventing success, and how we\'ll measure improvement. This forms the foundation of our UI modernization roadmap.',
    subQuestions: [
      '1. "Can you walk me through the top 3 user workflows that cause the most problems or have the biggest business impact?"',
      '2. "For each journey, who are the users? (Roles, technical proficiency, frequency of use)"',

      '4. "How is this currently measured? (Do you have analytics, error rates, completion times, support tickets?)"',
      '5. "What would success look like? (How much faster, fewer errors, higher completion rate?)"',
      '6. "What\'s the business impact of fixing this? (Revenue, efficiency, customer satisfaction, compliance risk?)"',
      '7. "Can you show me the current user flow? (Screenshots, screen recording, or walk through live)"',

    ],
    whyItMatters: 'These three journeys will drive your entire UI transformation budget, timeline, and success criteria. Without clear prioritization and measurable outcomes, we risk building the wrong features or being unable to demonstrate ROI. This also helps us right-size the project scope and set realistic expectations with stakeholders. The specific metrics become our baseline for measuring transformation success and justifying the investment in the Statement of Work.',

    detailedQuestion: 'Front-End Technology Inventory and Observability Assessment: We need a complete inventory of your UI technology landscape to assess technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and migration complexity. This includes all frameworks, libraries, build tools, and dependencies across all applications and modules. Equally important is understanding what visibility you have into production behavior - analytics, error tracking, performance monitoring, and user behavior tracking. This determines our ability to measure improvement and troubleshoot issues during and after migration.',
    subQuestions: [
      '1. "What front-end frameworks and libraries are you using? (Please include version numbers)"',
      '2. "Walk me through your package.json or dependency list - what are the key dependencies?"',

    ],
    whyItMatters: 'Your technology stack determines migration strategy, effort estimates, and total cost. Legacy frameworks mean higher migration complexity. Missing monitoring means we\'re flying blind during deployment. Known security vulnerabilities create compliance risk. This assessment directly feeds into the technical approach section of the SOW, including timeline, team composition, and technology recommendations. It also identifies any blockers (like IE11 support preventing modern framework adoption) that must be addressed.',

This includes missing endpoints, performance issues, authentication barriers, rate limiting problems, or SLA violations. Understanding these gaps helps us prioritize API development and set appropriate service level objectives for the new architecture. We also need to understand the business impact of these limitations - what revenue, efficiency, or customer experience improvements are being blocked.',
    subQuestions: [

    whyItMatters: 'API limitations directly translate to blocked business value. Every missing or problematic API represents lost revenue, manual workarounds, or competitive disadvantage. This analysis helps us prioritize which APIs to build or fix first based on business impact. It also sets the performance requirements and SLA targets for the new API layer. In the SOW, this drives the API development roadmap, capacity planning, and success criteria. We need quantified impact to justify the investment and set appropriate expectations.',

This includes identifying data quality issues, establishing freshness requirements (real-time, hourly, daily, etc.), and defining accuracy expectations. We also need to understand the business impact of data delays or inaccuracies.
