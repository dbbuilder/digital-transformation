## Methodology Overview

### The Four-Corner Model

The transformation framework uses four quadrants:

```
┌────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
│  Future State — UI Layer   │  Current State — UI Layer  │
│  (Vision & Experience)     │  (Existing UX & Workflow)  │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────┤
│  Future State — Data & AI  │  Current State — Data & AI │
│  (Platform & Intelligence) │  (Databases & Integrations)│
└────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┘
```

Transformation proceeds diagonally, starting from Future UI Vision and Current Data Platform, then bridging across five tiers:

1. **UI Tier**: User interface and experience layer
2. **Mid-Tier/API**: Application logic and service layer
3. **Data Tier**: Databases, warehouses, and data platforms
4. **Cloud Platform**: Infrastructure, compute, and networking
5. **AI/External**: AI services and third-party integrations

### Dual Transformation Paths

#### AI-Free Path
- Deterministic, rule-based modernization
- Traditional best practices and proven technologies
- Suitable for compliance-heavy or risk-averse organizations
- No dependency on AI/ML models or generative AI

#### AI-Included Path
- Leverages AI for automation, prediction, and assistance
- Requires data quality, governance, and safety guardrails
- Includes copilots, RAG systems, and intelligent automation
- Human-in-the-loop for critical decision points

### Transformation Phases

1. **Discovery & Alignment** (Weeks 1-4)
   - Current state assessment
   - Future state vision
   - Gap analysis and prioritization

2. **Foundation** (Weeks 4-8)
   - Cloud baseline establishment
   - Data migration planning
   - Governance framework setup

3. **Modernization** (Weeks 8-16)
   - New API tier implementation
   - UI component library development
   - Data platform migration

4. **Intelligence Layer** (Weeks 16-24, AI path only)
   - ML Ops pipeline setup
   - AI copilot prototypes
   - Model evaluation and safety testing

5. **Optimization & Governance** (Weeks 24-32)
   - Observability and monitoring
   - Cost optimization
   - Compliance dashboards
