```markdown
# Sprint [Number] Retrospective
**Date**: [Date]
**Facilitator**: [Name]
**Format**: Start/Stop/Continue
**Duration**: 1 hour

## What Went Well (Start Doing / Continue)
- ‚úÖ Daily stand-ups were focused and timely
- ‚úÖ Code reviews turned around within 4 hours (faster than last sprint)
- ‚úÖ Terraform templates worked flawlessly
- ‚úÖ Great collaboration between Alice and Bob on API design

## What Didn't Go Well (Stop Doing / Improve)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements changed mid-sprint (modal component scope expanded)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment to staging took longer than expected (manual steps)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database migration script had bugs (insufficient testing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Context switching for David (too many support interruptions)

## Ideas and Experiments
- üí° Freeze requirements after sprint planning (only change if critical)
- üí° Automate deployment pipeline (eliminate manual steps)
- üí° Add pre-deployment validation for migration scripts
- üí° Allocate 20% of David's time to "support window" explicitly

## Action Items (Top 3 Improvements for Next Sprint)
1. **Owner**: Scrum Master
   **Action**: Establish requirement freeze policy (changes require re-planning)
   **Due**: Before next sprint planning

2. **Owner**: David
   **Action**: Implement automated deployment pipeline for staging
   **Due**: Sprint N+1, Week 1

3. **Owner**: Carol
   **Action**: Create migration script testing checklist
   **Due**: Sprint N+1, Week 1

## Appreciation Shout-outs
- üëè Alice for helping Bob debug tricky React issue
- üëè Carol for staying late to finish data migration (voluntary)
- üëè Bob for excellent code review feedback (detailed and constructive)

## Team Health Check (1-5 scale, 5 = excellent)
| Dimension | Rating | Comments |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Collaboration | 5 | Great pairing and support |
| Workload | 3 | David overloaded, others balanced |
| Morale | 4 | Positive energy |
| Clarity of Goals | 5 | Very clear sprint goals |
| Tools and Resources | 4 | Pipeline automation needed |

**Overall Team Happiness**: 4.2 / 5
