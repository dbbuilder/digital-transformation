• Service mesh: Istio/Linkerd

Each service:
✓ Independent deployment
✓ Own database (polyglot persistence)
✓ API versioning (semver)
✓ Circuit breakers (Polly)
```

**Slide 12: API Design Standards**
```
RESTful API Conventions

Endpoint Structure:
GET    /api/v1/users           (List users)
GET    /api/v1/users/{id}      (Get user)
POST   /api/v1/users           (Create user)
PUT    /api/v1/users/{id}      (Update user)
PATCH  /api/v1/users/{id}      (Partial update)
DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}      (Delete user)

Response Format (JSON:API):
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "type": "user",
    "attributes": { ... },
    "relationships": { ... }
  },
  "meta": {
    "version": "1.2.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-17T10:00:00Z"
  }
}

Standards:
✓ Pagination (cursor-based)
✓ Filtering & sorting (query params)
✓ Rate limiting (429 response)
✓ Idempotency keys (POST/PATCH)
✓ ETags for caching
```

**Slide 13: Authentication & Authorization**
```
Security Model

Authentication Flow:
1. User logs in → OAuth 2.0 / OIDC
2. Identity Provider (Azure AD / Auth0)
3. Returns JWT access token + refresh token
4. Client includes token in Authorization header
5. API validates signature + claims

Authorization:
├─ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
│  └─ Roles: Admin, Manager, User, Guest
├─ Attribute-Based (ABAC)
│  └─ Policies based on user/resource attributes
└─ Resource-level permissions
   └─ Fine-grained (can edit own records only)

Token Security:
• Short-lived access tokens (15 min)
• Refresh token rotation
• Token revocation list
• Secure cookie storage (httpOnly, sameSite)

Additional: MFA enforced for admin roles
```

**Slide 14: API Gateway Pattern**
```
Centralized API Management

[Diagram]

External Clients

   │ • API versioning       │
   └───┬────────────────────┘
       │
   Internal Microservices

Benefits:
✓ Single entry point
✓ Centralized security
✓ Protocol translation (SOAP→REST)
✓ Request/response modification
✓ A/B testing & canary releases
✓ Developer portal (self-service)

Rate Limits:
• Anonymous: 100 req/min
• Authenticated: 1000 req/min
• Premium: 10,000 req/min
```

**Slide 15: Error Handling & Resilience**
```
Building Fault-Tolerant APIs

Resilience Patterns:
├─ Retry with exponential backoff
│  └─ Max 3 retries, jitter added
├─ Circuit breaker (Polly/.NET)
│  └─ Open after 5 consecutive failures
├─ Bulkhead isolation
│  └─ Limit concurrent requests per service
├─ Timeout policies
│  └─ 30s default, configurable
└─ Fallback strategies
   └─ Return cached data or default response

Error Response Format:
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid email format",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "issue": "Must be valid email address"
      }
    ],
    "traceId": "abc-def-123",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-17T10:00:00Z"
  }
}

Observability: All errors logged with context
```

**Slide 17: Data Migration Strategy**
```
Wave-Based Migration Approach

[Gantt chart showing waves]

Wave 1 (Weeks 5-8): Low-risk reference data
├─ Product catalog
├─ Customer master data
├─ Lookup tables
└─ Success criteria: <1% data quality issues

Wave 2 (Weeks 9-12): Transactional data
├─ Orders (historical)
├─ Invoices
├─ Inventory movements
└─ Success criteria: Reconciliation 100% match

Wave 3 (Weeks 13-16): Real-time operational
├─ Active orders (parallel run)
├─ Live inventory
├─ Customer sessions
└─ Success criteria: <1s latency

Wave 4 (Weeks 17-20): Analytics & ML
├─ Historical aggregations
├─ ML training datasets
├─ Reporting cubes
└─ Success criteria: Query performance 10x faster

Validation at each wave:
✓ Row counts match
✓ Data quality checks pass
✓ Business logic preserved
✓ Performance SLAs met
```

#### Tier 4: Cloud Infrastructure (Slides 21-25)

**Slide 21: Cloud Platform Strategy**
```
Multi-Cloud vs. Single Cloud

Decision: [Azure / AWS / GCP / Multi-cloud]

Rationale:
✓ [Existing relationships with Microsoft]
✓ [Integration with Office 365 / AD]
✓ [Region availability matches our markets]
✓ [Cost modeling shows 35% savings]
✓ [Team has Azure certifications]

Architecture Pattern: Cloud-agnostic design
• Terraform for IaC (not CloudFormation)
• Kubernetes for compute (portable)
• Standard APIs (S3-compatible, not proprietary)
• Multi-region deployment

Exit strategy:
• 12-month migration to different cloud
• All services have equivalent in AWS/GCP
• Data export formats: Parquet, JSON, CSV

Primary: Azure (70%)
Secondary: AWS (30% - specific services)
```

Every Month You Wait:
├─ Competitors gain market share
├─ Technical debt compounds
├─ Customer frustration grows
├─ Talent harder to attract
└─ Transformation becomes harder

But rushing is expensive too:
├─ Wrong architecture = rework
├─ Incomplete planning = scope creep
├─ Ignoring compliance = fines
└─ Poor execution = failed project

The right time is now—with the right partner.

We can start in 2 weeks.

**Slide 3: Compliance-by-Design Approach**
```
Built-In, Not Bolted-On

Traditional Approach:
Build first → Compliance audit → Scramble to fix → Delay launch

Our Approach:
Requirements → Controls mapped → Built-in → Validated → Launch

[Diagram showing integration]

Planning Phase:
├─ Identify applicable regulations
├─ Map controls to architecture tiers
└─ Define acceptance criteria

Development Phase:
├─ Controls implemented in code
├─ Automated compliance checks in CI/CD
└─ Regular audits

Launch Phase:
├─ Third-party audit
├─ Remediate any findings
└─ Continuous monitoring

Result: Compliant from day 1

**Slide 9: Privacy-by-Design Principles**
```
Seven Foundational Principles

1. Proactive not Reactive
   └─ Privacy impact assessments before features

2. Privacy as Default Setting
   └─ Minimal data collection, opt-in for non-essential

3. Privacy Embedded in Design
   └─ Not added later, built into architecture

4. Full Functionality (Positive-Sum)
   └─ Privacy doesn't compromise usability

5. End-to-End Security
   └─ Lifecycle protection (collection → deletion)

6. Visibility and Transparency
   └─ Clear privacy policy, data practices disclosed

7. Respect for User Privacy
   └─ User-centric controls

Implementation Examples:
├─ Cookie consent banner (granular options)
├─ Privacy dashboard (view/export/delete data)
├─ Anonymization for analytics
├─ Minimal data in logs (no PII)
└─ Regular privacy training for team
```

**Slide 10: Data Classification & Handling**

## 8. Visual Assets and Design Guidelines

### Design Principles

**Color Palette**:
```
Primary: #0066CC (Trust blue)
Secondary: #00AA66 (Growth green)
Accent: #FF6B35 (Energy orange)
Neutral: #333333 (Charcoal)
Background: #F5F5F5 (Light gray)
Error: #D32F2F (Red)
Success: #388E3C (Green)
Warning: #F57C00 (Amber)
```

**Typography**:
- Headings: Sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica, Calibri)
- Body: Sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica, Calibri)
- Code: Monospace (Consolas, Courier New)
- Sizes:
  - Title: 44pt
  - Heading 1: 32pt
  - Heading 2: 24pt
  - Body: 18pt
  - Caption: 14pt

**Layout Guidelines**:
- Use consistent slide master across all decks
- Maximum 6 bullet points per slide (3-4 ideal)
- Use visuals over text (diagrams, charts, icons)
- White space is your friend
- Align elements to grid (don't free-float)

**Icon Library**:
- Use consistent icon set (e.g., Font Awesome, Material Icons)
- Icons for tiers:
  - UI: 🖥️ or monitor icon
  - API: ⚙️ or cog icon
  - Data: 💾 or database icon
  - Cloud: ☁️ or cloud icon
  - AI: 🤖 or brain icon

**Diagram Standards**:
- Use draw.io / Lucidchart / Visio
- Standard shapes:
  - Rectangle: Components/systems
  - Cylinder: Databases
  - Cloud shape: Cloud services
  - Actor: Users
  - Arrows: Data flow (labeled)
- Color code by tier (consistent with palette)

**Chart Best Practices**:
- Use appropriate chart types:
  - Trends over time: Line chart
  - Comparisons: Bar chart
  - Proportions: Pie/donut chart
  - Relationships: Scatter plot
  - Processes: Gantt/flow chart
- Always label axes
- Use color meaningfully (not just decoration)
- Provide data source/date

### Reusable Visual Elements

**Four-Corner Diagram Template**:
```
[See FourCorner_DualPath_Transformation.drawio for reference]

Create in: PowerPoint SmartArt or draw.io

Structure:
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│  FUTURE STATE   │  CURRENT STATE  │
│     UI/UX       │     UI/UX       │
│                 │                 │
│  [Modern SPA]   │  [Legacy forms] │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│  FUTURE STATE   │  CURRENT STATE  │
│  DATA PLATFORM  │  DATA PLATFORM  │
│                 │                 │
│  [Cloud lake]   │  [On-prem SQL]  │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
         ↓ Transformation Path ↓
```

**Five-Tier Stack Diagram**:
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│  Tier 5: AI/External     │ (Orange)
├──────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 4: Cloud Platform  │ (Purple)
├──────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 3: Data Platform   │ (Blue)
├──────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 2: API/Services    │ (Green)
├──────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 1: UI/UX           │ (Teal)
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**Roadmap Gantt Chart Template**:
```
[Use Excel/Google Sheets or project management tool]

Columns:
- Phase name
- Start date
- End date
- Duration
- Owner
- Status

Rows: 12 phases from TODO.md

Export as image for inclusion in slides
```

**Metrics Dashboard Mockup**:
```
[Create in Excel, Tableau, or design tool]

Sections:
- KPI summary cards (4-6 metrics)
- Trend line charts (velocity, quality)
- Status indicators (RAG - Red/Amber/Green)
- Recent activity feed

Make it visual and scannable
```

### Slide Deck File Organization

**File Naming Convention**:
```
[Company]_[Deck Type]_[Version]_[Date].pptx

Examples:
- Acme_Executive_Overview_v1.0_2025-10-17.pptx
- Acme_Technical_Architecture_v2.1_2025-10-17.pptx
- Acme_Phase_Gate_Review_Phase3_v1.0_2025-10-17.pptx
```

**Version Control**:
- Use Git for version control (store .pptx in repo)
- Alternatively: SharePoint/Google Drive with version history
- Tag major versions (e.g., v1.0 for exec approval)
- Keep previous versions archived

**Deck Repository Structure**:
```
/presentations
  /executive
    - executive_overview.pptx
    - board_presentation.pptx
  /technical
    - architecture_deep_dive.pptx
    - technology_selection.pptx
  /sales
    - consultant_sales_deck.pptx
    - case_studies.pptx
  /project
    - stakeholder_kickoff.pptx
    - phase_gate_template.pptx

## 9. Customization Guidance

### How to Adapt These Decks

**For Your Organization**:
1. Replace placeholders:
   - [Company Logo] → Your logo
   - [Project Name] → Your project name
   - [Name/Title] → Your team members
   - $[X]M → Your actual budget
   - [Date] → Actual dates

2. Adjust scope:
   - Remove AI slides if AI-Free path
   - Add/remove compliance regulations as applicable
   - Customize technology stack to your decisions

3. Tailor examples:
   - Use your actual use cases
   - Reference your current systems
   - Include your industry context

**For Different Audiences**:
- **Technical audience**: Go deeper on architecture, less on business value
- **Business audience**: Focus on ROI, timeline, risks
- **C-Suite**: Keep it high-level, emphasize strategic impact
- **Board**: Financial metrics, competitive positioning, governance

**For Different Phases**:
- **Discovery**: Current state assessment, options analysis
- **Execution**: Progress updates, demos, phase gates
- **Launch**: Go-live readiness, success metrics, support plan
- **Post-launch**: ROI realization, lessons learned, next phase

### Presentation Tips

**Before the Meeting**:
- Send deck 24 hours in advance
- Rehearse (especially demos)
- Test technology (screen share, video, remote attendees)
- Prepare for questions (FAQ sheet)

**During the Meeting**:
- Start with agenda and timing
- Use parking lot for off-topic questions
- Pause for questions throughout (don't wait until end)
- Watch the clock (end on time)
- Capture action items visibly

**After the Meeting**:
- Send meeting notes within 24 hours
- Include decisions made
- List action items with owners and due dates
- Provide link to full documentation

## 10. Export and Distribution

### PowerPoint/Google Slides Creation

These markdown outlines can be converted to actual slide decks using:

**Option 1: Manual Creation**
- Copy/paste content into PowerPoint/Google Slides
- Apply consistent template
- Add visuals (diagrams, charts, images)
- Most control, most time-intensive

**Option 2: Markdown-to-Slides Tools**
- [Marp](https://marp.app/): Markdown presentation ecosystem
- [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/): HTML-based presentations from Markdown
- [Slidev](https://sli.dev/): Presentation slides for developers
- Faster, but less design flexibility

**Option 3: AI-Assisted**
- Use Claude or ChatGPT to generate .pptx directly
- Requires additional prompting with this content
- Iterate to refine design

### PDF Export for Distribution

For read-only distribution:
- Export as PDF (PowerPoint → Save As → PDF)
- Benefits: No editing, works everywhere, smaller file size
- Use for: Sending to large groups, archival, public sharing

### Video Recordings

For asynchronous consumption:
- Record presentation with narration (Loom, Zoom, Teams)
- Edit and upload to YouTube (unlisted) or internal portal
- Provide transcript for accessibility
- Use for: Training, onboarding, knowledge sharing
